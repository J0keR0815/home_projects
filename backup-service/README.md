* These scripts were used to backup my data.
* They create local service backups for `dokuwiki`, `gitea` and `nextcloud`
* The backup server pulls the service backups and creates a local backup automatically (`backup1`), a 2nd local backup on demand (`backup2`) and a remote storage backup (`storagebox`)
